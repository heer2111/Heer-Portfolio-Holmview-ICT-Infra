# Holmview ICT Infrastructure â€“ Personal Portfolio (Heer Pathrishi)

This repository showcases my personal contributions to a group project designing a secure network infrastructure for Holmview State Primary School. The project simulated VLANs, access control, file servers, and wireless network integration.

## My Contributions

- **Gateway & Subnet Configuration**  
  Configured static IPs, subnet masks, and default gateways for all VLANs (Admin, Staff, Student, IoT).

- **File Server & VLAN Access Demo**  
  Simulated file sharing and access controls across VLANs using Packet Tracer.

- **Wireless Router Setup**  
  Assisted with VLAN-aware wireless router config for secure network extension.

- **Project Management via GitHub**  
  Used Kanban board to assign tasks, track issues, and upload documentation.
